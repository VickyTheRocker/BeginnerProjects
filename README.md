# Hacktoberfest 2022

Hacktoberfest is the easiest way to get into open source! Hacktoberfest is a month long festival of open source code presented by Digital Ocean and DEV this year in 2022.

During the entire month of October 2022, all you have to do is contribute to any open source projects and open at least 4 pull requests. Yes, any project and any kind of contributions. It can be a be a bug fix, improvement, or even a documentation change! And win a T-Shirt and awesome stickers.
