# Number Guess Game

This is a simple number guessing game. The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. The program will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low. The user will have 10 chances to guess the correct number. If the user guesses the correct number, the program will tell the user they won. If the user does not guess the correct number, the program will tell the user they lost.
